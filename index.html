	<h1>Welcome to my new blog!</h1>
	<p>I am a computer tech who has owned and operated a repair shop since 2011.</p>
	<p>I have learned a lot in that time and have decided it is time to start giving back to the online community in my own small way. I will be sharing my adventures in fixing computers by posting here on my GitHub page using Jekyll <a href="https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">thanks to this excellent tutorial</a>.</p>
